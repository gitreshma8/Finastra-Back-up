Hello Mick,You can approve early reliving for Reshma. You have to approve her request by replying to her original email. She will have to then raise a ticket on People Portal for changing her exit date on Workday. She will have to attach your approval email with the request.Our people services team will compensate her notice period shortage with the Time-Off balance she has on her date of relieving. If she is not having sufficient time-off balance, they will adjust the notice shortfall it in her final paycheck.
